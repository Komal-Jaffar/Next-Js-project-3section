      <b> WEB DEVELOPER</b><br></br>
   Web development is the act of building, creating and maintaining websites. The field encompasses
         a broad range of tasks including everything from coding, to technical design, to the performance of a 
         website or application running on the internet. Web development consists of front-end and back-end
          components..<br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>

   <b>Front-End Web Development vs. Back-End Web Development</b><br></br>
   <br></br>
    <b>Front-end development</b><br></br> consists of the user interface (UI) and the look and feel of the website or application.<br></br> 
    <b>Back-end development</b><br></br> consists of the databases, logic, APIs, servers and everything else that powers the website
     behind the scenes.<br></br>
     <br></br>
 

    <b>What Are the 3 Types of Web Development?</b><br></br>
    There are three main types of web development: front-end, back-end and full-stack.<br></br>

    Web development broadly encompasses the whole of a website's functionality, but the work itself is often 
    broken down into three types: <br></br>
    <br></br>

    <b>1-Front-end development</b> is responsible for the aspects of a website that users see and interact with:
     the user interface (UI). Front-end developers are well-versed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, often working
      closely with design and UX teams to capture both the intended look and feel of the site, while also creating 
      a quality user experience across multiple device types.<br></br>

    <b>2-Back-end development</b> is responsible for all the aspects of a website that users do not see. This is also
     known as server-side development because back-end developers focus primarily on the behind-the-scenes logic,
      APIs and database interactions that power the site.<br></br> 

    <b>3-Full-stack development</b> is a more holistic approach where the developers responsible for the site or app
     take care of the entire development stack, from the inner workings typically performed on the back-end to the 
     presentation layer normally handled by front-end developers.

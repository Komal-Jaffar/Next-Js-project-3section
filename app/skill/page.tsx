            Examples of web developer skills
To become a web developer, you'll need a variety of hard and soft skills to 
succeed. Here are some of the most common skills to have in this role:<br></br>

HTML/CSS skills:
If you hope to become a web developer, you must understand HTML and CSS. HTML
 is the most used markup language across the web, and web developers use it to
  create web pages on the Internet. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style the
   website. It's responsible for the choice of fonts, colors and layout in a website's
    design. Whereas HTML lays the foundation for a webpage, CSS styles it.<br></br>

Analytical skills:
As a web developer, you'll need to have keen analytical skills to create a variety of
 successful websites. This involves ensuring the coding is correct and the website is functional.
Also, it's important to understand the needs of your customers or clients. You'll need to analyze
 their wants and needs and be ready to adapt to any changes they'd like to see implemented on the website.
  The better you understand your client, the better your website will turn out for them in the end.<br></br>

Responsive design skills:
If you work as a web developer, it's important to understand how responsive design works. Because many 
people view web pages both online and on their mobile devices, the websites you create need to adapt to
 the changing screen sizes.<br></br>
If your website isn't responsive, this means it won't be compatible with either the desktop site or the mobile site. 
In other words, it won't function or show up properly on either of these platforms. Your ability to create a responsive
 design can also impact the number of visitors a website gets since most people are deterred from a website when it's not displaying properly.<br></br>

JavaScript skills:
You'll also need to understand JavaScript as a web developer. JavaScript is a high-level programming language that implements complex features 
onto a website. This involves things like moving elements, search bars, videos or interactive maps on a webpage. In knowing JavaScript, you'll be 
able to meet higher expectations from your clients in the web development process.
Using these skills, you'll be able to reel in more webpage viewers, as well, since the majority of people tend to prefer interactive web pages that
 grab their attention. Special features go a long way in engaging viewers, and your job as a web developer plays a large role in seeing them come to
  fruition on a digital screen.<br></br>

Testing and debugging skills:
As a web developer, it's important to know how to continuously test your webpage for any possible errors. Should any arise, you should also know how 
to debug it. Testing makes sure your coding is doing what it's supposed to and will come down to either functional testing or unit testing. Being able
 to consistently and effectively test and debug your webpage is essential in this role.<br></br>

Back-end basics:
You'll also need to understand some of the fundamentals of back-end web development. This is because you'll be working in collaboration with back-end
 developers or might be tasked with using these skills yourself. In this regard, you'll need to know how servers work as well as APIs, SQL, databases and
  cybersecurity. All of these are important skills to know as they relate to the server-side of a webpage.<br></br>

Search engine optimization:
As a web developer, you must know all about search engine optimization. This is because website traffic is becoming more and more important to companies.
 If a website has good SEO, it'll attract a greater number of webpage visitors by showing up high enough in search engine result pages. Because more and more
  companies are looking to have good SEO, it's an important skill to have as a web developer.
